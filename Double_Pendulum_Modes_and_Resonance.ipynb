    "\n",
    "The double pendulum — two point masses connected by massless rigid rods — is a classic system in mechanics. For large amplitudes it exhibits rich and often chaotic behavior, but for **small oscillations** it behaves like two coupled harmonic oscillators. This notebook focuses on that small-angle regime: we derive the Lagrangian, obtain equations of motion, linearize about the stable equilibrium, form the generalized eigenvalue problem, and compute the natural frequencies and mode shapes using SymPy.\n"
